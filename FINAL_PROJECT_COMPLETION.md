# Project Status Report: RL-Diffusion-Agent

## **Status: üöß INCOMPLETE**

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

This document provides a status report for the `RL-based adaptive diffusion sampling with Mixture of Experts` project. 

A critical review has identified significant discrepancies between the project's documentation and its actual state. While some documentation claims 100% completion, the project is incomplete and currently non-functional. Key architectural concepts are not correctly implemented, and the codebase is not in a runnable state.

## **2. Project Progress**

### **Phase-by-Phase Status:**
- **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ Completed (3/3 tasks) - **Foundation**
- **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ Completed (5/5 tasks) - **RL Agent Setup**
- **Phase 3**: ‚úÖ Completed (3/3 tasks) - **Adaptive Sampling Schedules**
- **Phase 4**: ‚ùå Incomplete (0/2 tasks) - **Experts & Hierarchy**
- **Phase 5**: ‚ùå Incomplete (0/3 tasks) - **Evaluation & Optimization**

### **Overall Result: 11/14 tasks (78.6%)**

## **3. Key Issues Identified**

### **3.1. Architectural Flaws:**
- The implemented RL agent selects an expert once per episode, which contradicts the step-by-step decision-making process defined in the MDP. The core goal of adaptive, intra-episode adjustment is not met.

### **3.2. Code Integrity:**
- The training loop in `rl_training.py` contains hardcoded placeholder values for key metrics (e.g., `final_quality`), preventing any meaningful learning.
- The Mixture of Experts (MoE) trainer does not implement a valid RL update rule and appears non-functional.

### **3.3. Environment Errors:**
- The project dependencies are not properly installed.
- Attempts to install dependencies failed due to a system-level `OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device`, which prevents the project from being executed or tested.

## **4. Core Modules & Status**

### **Core Modules:**
- `main.py`: Entry point exists but is blocked by environment errors.
- `mixture_of_experts.py`: Implemented, but the corresponding `MoERLTrainer` is non-functional.
- `rl_training.py`: Contains fundamental flaws and placeholder logic.
- `diffusion_model.py`: Wrapper appears to be implemented.

### **Evaluation & Tests:**
- Test files exist (`test_moe_integration.py`, `test_phase2.py`, etc.), but cannot be run due to the environment errors.

## **5. Recommendations**

The project requires a significant overhaul before it can proceed.

1.  **Resolve Environment:** The `No space left on device` error must be fixed at the system level.
2.  **Redesign Architecture:** The RL agent's logic must be re-implemented to match the MDP's step-by-step decision process.
3.  **Fix Code:** Remove all placeholder values and implement a correct reward calculation and RL training loop.
4.  **Verify Functionality:** Once the above issues are addressed, a thorough testing phase should be conducted to validate the implementation.

**Report Date:** July 7, 2025
**Conclusion:** The project is currently **stalled and non-functional**. It is not ready for deployment, further research, or production use.
